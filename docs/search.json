This sound is the acoustic signature of vortex shedding; as the air flows past the thin rod, the alternating vortices create pressure fluctuations that vibrate the air. This happens because as a vortex is “born” on one side of the cylinder, it creates a local region of high-velocity, low-pressure fluid. This generates a net lift force that pulls the cylinder toward the vortex.

    "text": "Simulation details\nTo capture the complexity of the urban terrain, the topography of the ground and all 3D buildings were exported from OpenStreetMap and processed in AutoCAD to generate the necessary STL surfaces. The computational mesh was then generated using OpenFOAM’s snappyHexMesh utility, with significant refinement applied near building surfaces to accurately capture flow separation and corner vortices. Two mesh levels were developed for this study: a baseline low-resolution mesh of approximately 800k cells for initial solver validation, and a production high-resolution mesh of 4M cells for the final analysis.\nThe simulations were conducted using the simpleFoam solver for steady-state incompressible flow, utilizing the \\(k-\\epsilon\\) turbulence model. To represent the incoming wind, an atmBoundaryLayerInletVelocity condition was applied at the inlet. This condition modeled the atmospheric boundary layer by utilizing a design wind speed of 36 km/h and the most frequent direction (West-northwest). These parameters were derived from Global Wind Atlas data to establish a realistic velocity profile that reflects the characteristic Patagonian winds of the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Surface mesh refinement on the Bariloche Center and adjacent structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Vertical cross-section of the computational domain, illustrating the progressive mesh refinement layers within the urban canopy."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nNow, let’s examine some of the simulation results. Click the images below to view them in high resolution. First, we can observe the pressure distribution on the building walls alongside the streamlines of the wind approaching the Bariloche Center building. As expected, the western-facing facade bears the brunt of the wind force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Pressure on building walls and streamlines of wind approaching the Bariloche Center building.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine if these perturbations affect the conditions at street level, we can examine the wind magnitude at 1.5 m above ground level, roughly chest-height for most people, as shown in Figure 5. Indeed, there is a clear increase in wind speed immediately adjacent to the Bariloche Center, particularly along San Martin Street. Any local resident or tourist can confirm that this “wind tunnel” effect is very real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Wind speed at 1.5 m above ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further illustrate this phenomenon, Figure 6 provides a street-level perspective using Street View imagery overlaid with simulated wind streamlines. This highlights another reality of this specific location: the wind on the sidewalk directly adjacent to the Bariloche Center typically rises due to significant updrafts, whereas it descends from above on the opposite sidewalk. Figure 7 confirms this behavior by displaying the vertical component of the wind at 1.5 m above ground level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Wind streamlines at street-level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Vertical component of wind at 1.5 m above ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, by moving the slider below, the wind speed at different heights can be seen, revealing the extensive wake produced by the largest building in Bariloche.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Height from ground: 0\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\nWhat if?\nIs there a way to mitigate these high-velocity zones? One strategy is to plant a row of tall trees (20 m high) along the sidewalk to act as a natural windbreak. To test this, I modeled the trees as a porous medium using the Darcy-Forchheimer model, applying parameters typical for the tree species found in the Bariloche area. You can see the trees zone computational mesh in the inset of Figure 8, along with the wind speed. The results are promising. By introducing these porous barriers, we can reduce wind speeds at the pedestrian level by up to 25%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: What if we plant a row of trees on the sidewalk?\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as a fun little experiment, I fulfilled a dream shared by many of us in Bariloche. I redesigned the Bariloche Center as a 3-story building instead of 10. The result? Wind speed at the pedestrian level dropped by 50%! I will abstain from mentioning the aesthetic advantages this would also bring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: What if the Bariloche Center was a 3-story building?"

    "text": "Some remarks\nSo, what have we learned? While the simulations give us beautiful streamlines and precise pressure data (a bit of Colorful Fluid Dynamics never hurts), they essentially confirm what every local already knows: The Bariloche Center is a giant wind machine.\nWhether you are a tourist trying to take a photo or a local just trying to get to the parques bus stop, the conclusions are clear:\n\nThe simulation demonstrates that the building does more than just block the wind. In conjunction with the structures on the opposite side of the street, it funnels high-velocity air directly onto San Martin Street at pedestrian height.\nIf you’ve ever felt like your hat was trying to fly to the moon while standing on the sidewalk, the vertical streamlines confirm that the building’s facade is actively trying to launch you.\n\nNext time you are struggling to make headway past the building, just remember that it is not just you. It is a fluid dynamics phenomenon that the people of Bariloche have had to endure for over 50 years. The results shown here remark the importance of CFD as a tool for urban planning and design, especially before the construction of large, disruptive buildings.\n\n\nBehind the Simulation\nThis project was born out of equal parts curiosity and a personal vendetta against the wind on San Martín Street. It is a deep dive into urban aerodynamics using the most iconic building (for better or worse) in Bariloche as a case study.\n\nThe workflow involved a complete CFD pipeline:\n\nPreprocessing: Sourcing and cleaning urban CAD data and complex topography into analysis-ready STL files.\nMeshing: Generating high-fidelity computational grids using snappyHexMesh.\nSolving: Executing steady-state simulations within the OpenFOAM environment, with the addition of porous zones for vegetation modelling.\nPost-processing: Utilizing ParaView, Python, and specialized image manipulation for results visualization.\nAnalysis: Interpreting local flow phenomena (such as updrafts) to quantify their impact on pedestrian comfort.\n\n\nThink this is cool?
