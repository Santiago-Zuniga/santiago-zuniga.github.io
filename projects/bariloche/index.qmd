## The Bariloche Center building
Anyone who has visited Bariloche is familiar with the Bariloche Center. Built in the 1970s, this ten-story concrete monolith stands in stark contrast to the traditional mountain village aesthetic of the Centro Cívico just meters away.  

Positioned almost perpendicular to the region's predominant winds, this massive slab acts as a giant blockage, forcing the air to accelerate as it tries to navigate around the structure. Local pedestrians know this effect all too well: even on days with only a slight breeze, the way the building disrupts and funnels the air creates intense, localized gusts at street level.  

As shown in the wind rose below, the frequency of these high-velocity events is directly tied to the dominant Western and North-Western wind directions hitting the building's broad face.

This brings up the question: How much does the Bariloche Center building really impact street-level wind gusts? We will answer that by using CFD tools to simulate the wind in the surrounding blocks and observing the resulting velocity fields.

## Simulation details
To capture the complexity of the urban terrain, the topography of the ground and all 3D buildings were exported from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and processed in AutoCAD to generate the necessary STL surfaces. The computational mesh was then generated using OpenFOAM’s `snappyHexMesh` utility, with significant refinement applied near building surfaces to accurately capture flow separation and corner vortices. Two mesh levels were developed for this study: a baseline low-resolution mesh of approximately 800k cells for initial solver validation, and a production high-resolution mesh of 4M cells for the final analysis.

The simulations were conducted using the `simpleFoam` solver for steady-state incompressible flow, utilizing the $k-\epsilon$ turbulence model. To represent the incoming wind, an `atmBoundaryLayerInletVelocity` condition was applied at the inlet. This condition modeled the atmospheric boundary layer by utilizing a design wind speed of 36 km/h and the most frequent direction (West-northwest). These parameters were derived from [Global Wind Atlas](https://globalwindatlas.info) data to establish a realistic velocity profile that reflects the characteristic Patagonian winds of the region.

## Results
Now, let’s examine some of the simulation results. Click the images below to view them in high resolution. First, we can observe the pressure distribution on the building walls alongside the streamlines of the wind approaching the *Bariloche Center* building. As expected, the western-facing facade bears the brunt of the wind force.

To determine if these perturbations affect the conditions at street level, we can examine the **wind magnitude at 1.5 m above ground level**, roughly chest-height for most people, as shown in Figure 5. Indeed, there is a clear increase in wind speed immediately adjacent to the *Bariloche Center*, particularly along San Martin Street. Any local resident or tourist can confirm that this "wind tunnel" effect is very real.

To further illustrate this phenomenon, Figure 6 provides a street-level perspective using Street View imagery overlaid with simulated wind streamlines. This highlights another reality of this specific location: the wind on the sidewalk directly adjacent to the *Bariloche Center* typically rises due to significant updrafts, whereas it descends from above on the opposite sidewalk. Figure 7 confirms this behavior by displaying the vertical component of the wind at 1.5 m above ground level.

Finally, by moving the slider below, the wind speed at different heights can be seen, revealing the extensive wake produced by the largest building in Bariloche.

  <img id="heightSliderImage" src="images/slices/anim.0000.jpeg" style="width:100%; max-width:900px; border-radius: 5px;">
  
  <div style="margin-top: 15px;">

  </div>

  <script>
    (function() {
      const slider = document.getElementById('heightSlider');
      const imgDisplay = document.getElementById('heightSliderImage');
      const valDisplay = document.getElementById('heightValue');

      if (!slider || !imgDisplay) return;

      const totalImages = 40; 
      const imageFolder = "./images/slices/"; 
      const images = [];

      for (let i = 0; i <= totalImages; i++) {
        const img = new Image();
        const frameName = i.toString().padStart(4, '0');
        // Standardized to .jpeg
        img.src = `${imageFolder}anim.${frameName}.jpeg`;
        images.push(img);
        
        // Debugging the first path
        if (i === 0) console.log("Attempting to load:", img.src);
      }

      slider.oninput = function() {
        const idx = parseInt(this.value);
        if (images[idx]) {
          imgDisplay.src = images[idx].src;
          valDisplay.innerHTML = (idx + 0.5) + " m";
        }
      };
    })();
  </script>
</div>
```



## Some remarks

So, what have we learned? While the simulations give us beautiful streamlines and precise pressure data (a bit of *Colorful Fluid Dynamics* never hurts), they essentially confirm what every local already knows: **The *Bariloche Center* is a giant wind machine.**

Whether you are a tourist trying to take a photo or a local just trying to get to the *parques* bus stop, the conclusions are clear:

* The simulation demonstrates that the building does more than just block the wind. In conjunction with the structures on the opposite side of the street, it funnels high-velocity air directly onto San Martin Street at pedestrian height.
* If you’ve ever felt like your hat was trying to fly to the moon while standing on the sidewalk, the vertical streamlines confirm that the building's facade is actively trying to launch you.

Next time you are struggling to make headway past the building, just remember that it is not just you. It is a fluid dynamics phenomenon that the people of Bariloche have had to endure for over 50 years.

### Behind the Simulation

This project was born out of equal parts curiosity and a personal vendetta against the wind on San Martín Street. It is a deep dive into urban aerodynamics using the most iconic building (for better or worse) in Bariloche as a case study.

The workflow involved a complete CFD pipeline:

* **Preprocessing:** Sourcing and cleaning urban CAD data and complex topography into analysis-ready STL files.
* **Meshing:** Generating high-fidelity computational grids using `snappyHexMesh`.
* **Solving:** Executing steady-state simulations within the **OpenFOAM** environment.
* **Post-processing:** Utilizing **ParaView**, **Python**, and specialized image manipulation for results visualization.
