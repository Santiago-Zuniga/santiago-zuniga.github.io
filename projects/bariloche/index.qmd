## The Bariloche Center building
Anyone who has visited Bariloche is familiar with the Bariloche Center. Built in the 1970s, this ten-story concrete monolith stands in stark contrast to the traditional mountain village aesthetic of the Centro Cívico just meters away.  

Positioned almost perpendicular to the region's predominant winds, this massive slab acts as a giant blockage, forcing the air to accelerate as it tries to navigate around the structure. Local pedestrians know this effect all too well: even on days with only a slight breeze, the way the building disrupts and funnels the air creates intense, localized gusts at street level.  

As shown in the wind rose below, the frequency of these high-velocity events is directly tied to the dominant Western and North-Western wind directions hitting the building's broad face.

This brings up the question: How much does the Bariloche Center building really impact street-level wind gusts? We will answer that by using CFD tools to simulate the wind in the surrounding blocks and observing the resulting velocity fields.

## Simulation details
To capture the complexity of the urban terrain, the topography of the ground and all 3D buildings were exported from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and processed in AutoCAD to generate the necessary STL surfaces. The computational mesh was then generated using OpenFOAM’s `snappyHexMesh` utility, with significant refinement applied near building surfaces to accurately capture flow separation and corner vortices. Two mesh levels were developed for this study: a baseline low-resolution mesh of approximately 800k cells for initial solver validation, and a production high-resolution mesh of 4M cells for the final analysis.

The simulations were conducted using the `simpleFoam` solver for steady-state incompressible flow, utilizing the `k-epsilon` turbulence model. To represent the incoming wind, an `atmBoundaryLayerInletVelocity` condition was applied at the inlet. This condition modeled the atmospheric boundary layer by utilizing the average wind speed and direction, derived from [Global Wind Atlas](https://globalwindatlas.info) data to establish a realistic velocity profile.

## Discussion
The simulation suggests that a 15% increase in porous barriers leads to a 25% reduction in pedestrian-level wind speeds in the target zones.
