## The Problem
In Bariloche, the prevailing Patagonian winds create high-shear zones in the city center. This project explores how urban vegetation can be strategically placed to mitigate wind erosion.

## Simulation Framework
To capture the complexity of the urban terrain, I utilized:
* **Solver:** `simpleFoam` for steady-state incompressible flow.
* **Meshing:** `snappyHexMesh` refined around building edges.
* **Porosity:** Trees were modeled as porous zones with Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients.

## Discussion
The simulation suggests that a 15% increase in porous barriers leads to a 25% reduction in pedestrian-level wind speeds in the target zones.
